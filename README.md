# Spam_mail_prediction
This is a Spam Mail Detection project developed using Python and popular data science libraries. The system can accurately classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using machine learning models trained on labeled email data.
ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
Preprocessing of email text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Training and evaluation of classification models (Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.)

Real-time prediction: Enter any email text to check if itâ€™s spam or not

Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk

Jupyter Notebook or .py script interface

ðŸ“Š Model Performance:
Achieved over 95% accuracy on validation set

Tested with different ML algorithms: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
